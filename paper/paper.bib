	abstract = {Decades of investment decisions by central planners left communist societies with structures of production ill-prepared for competitive markets. Similar to the effects identified in the “China shock” literature, post-market-shock outcomes reflect pre-market-shock industrial geography. Tracking presidential voting in Russia at the district level in the 1990s, we document asymmetric reactions to the rapid liberalization of markets in 1992. Electoral support for the pro-market incumbent, as well as nighttime light intensity, declined more in districts whose inherited structures of production made them more vulnerable to reforms. By controlling for provincial fixed effects, we plausibly filter out the impact of post-1992 policy variation, allowing us to shed new light on an old debate about the importance of “initial conditions” to the trajectories of post-communist societies.},

The state governors are classified along a 5-item autonomy index based on events data and content analysis of their speeches, declarations, petitions, threats and actions from 1991–1995 as reported in two regional sources. Theoretical propositions derived from four schools of thought (essentialism, instrumentalism, relative deprivation and resource mobilization) are tested to discover which, if any, provide useful insights into the preferences and behavior of regional elites in Russia. In the end, a combined model that synthesizes elements of the above is shown to be most useful in explaining variation in elite positions.},

	abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to examine the nature of federal bargaining in post-Soviet Russia by comparing Moscow̕s negotiations with Russia̕s two oil-rich republics in the Middle Volga: Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. In particular, the thesis attempts to explain how Bashkortostan was able to gain autonomy from Moscow that is very close to the level of autonomy enjoyed by Tatarstan, despite the fact that Bashkortostan is clearly in a disadvantageous position when compared to Tatarstan and the Bashkorts form only the third largest ethnic group in the Republic after the Russians and the Tatars. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that sometimes the relatively disadvantageous party in federal bargaining might be given more autonomy not because of its bargaining power, but because of the general bargaining strategy of the federal center. Therefore this thesis is an attempt to understand how Moscow, fearing that Tatarstan might emerge as the hegemonic power in the Middle Volga, sought to strengthen the position of Bashkortostan against Tatarstan, and how the success of the Bashkort political elite to manipulate the weaknesses of Moscow in the post-Soviet arena provided Bashkortostan with more or less same degree of autonomy compared to that of Tatarstan̕s.},

This article compares the practices of the allocation of political ofﬁces in Russian national republics and aims to examine to what extent they depend on the ethnic composition of the population. Comparative analysis demonstrates that although ethnic lines are a signiﬁcant factor in regional politics in almost all the cases, stable practices of power-sharing have emerged in approximately half of Russian national republics. Since Russian legislation does not allow ethnic parties, ethnic quotas or similar arrangements, informal power-sharing conventions are used so that speciﬁc political positions are attached to speciﬁc ethnic groups. In multisegmented republics, all signiﬁcant ethnic groups have their ‘own’ position in accordance with the share of the group in the population. In bi-segmented republics, a dominant ethnic group controls the main post of Head while a minority group is given second-order positions. At the same time, there are some cases where the allocation of positions deviates from the ethnic structure.},

Many Russian politicians and most scholars of Russian politics view asymmetric bilateral bargaining as a dangerous institutional choice contributing to federal instability and potentially threatening the disintegration of Russia. We offer an alternative view. While the treaty-signing practices are actively maintained by Russian political elites, we argue that the genesis of asymmetric bilateral bargaining in Russia had a strong ‘path dependence’ component. In particular, it was precipitated by the developments of the last period in evolution of the Soviet federalism.},

	abstract = {The growing research on fiscal and political federalism in economics (as well as rational choice political science) basically shares two main assumptions regarding federal institutions: it takes democratic and symmetric federations as the reference point. Democracy means that the decision making is based on elections and/or referenda, which effectively constraint the actions of politicians. Symmetry means that the ”degree of devolution” for all regions is identical. In particular, if both federal and regional budgets are funded by a common split tax, the de-jure retention rate is identical for all states. It goes without saying that there is a multitude of models looking at economic asymmetry between regions: most federations include states or regions with significantly different economic potential, population and territory, obviously influencing both their comparative economic performance and their behavior in the federal bargaining. However, the economic asymmetry does not (necessarily) provide an identity mapping into the asymmetric devolution in terms of formal institutions and informal policy making (what I refer to as ”asymmetric federation” in this paper): this issue requires careful analysis.},

This paper examines statistically why some—such as Chechnya and Tatarstan—have come to epitomize demands for greater independence, while others—such as Mordovia or Chukotka—have remained largely quiescent. It finds that, while a Muslim religious tradition predisposed a region's leaders to press greater separatist demands, such primordial factors werefilteredthrough a rational calculus of the region's relative bargaining power in negotiations with the center and of the leader's own organizational interests. Contrary to some leading theories, the most developed, resource-rich, and high-income groups and regions were more separatist than more economically backward ones.},

Why have relatively advantaged ethnic groups been most assertive, whereas groups near the lower end of most comparative measures of socioeconomic and political success have been relatively quiescent?

	abstract = {The constituent power theory, which served critical functions for several years, has outlived its utility as the preeminent yardstick to measure the normative legitimacy of a constitution. As the theory stands, it cannot apply on its own terms to most instances of modern constitutionmaking. At the same time, it is highly susceptible to being used to legitimize authoritarian outcomes. The scholarly literature that attempts to reimagine or expand the theory is scant and unable to overcome its problems. In response, this article develops an alternative standard: the theory of equitable elite bargaining. This theory provides that a constitution is normatively legitimate if it is the product of an equitable bargain between elites from most major political groups in society at the moment of constitution-making. The theory of equitable elite bargaining is applicable to the realities of modern constitution-making and makes it more difficult to legitimize authoritarian constitutions. Further, both representation-based and consequentialist arguments can justify a constitution drafted in accordance with the theory as normatively legitimate. The theory imposes a standard that can result in arduous constitution-making processes and moderated constitutional content. Additionally, its focus on elites poses challenging questions. However, this article will argue that the net benefits of this theory warrant its consideration as a new standard to assess normative constitutional legitimacy.},

I argue that the ethnofederal designs of these states were themselves the consequences of prior nationalist mobilizations in the Russian empire and the Balkans. I also criticize this literature for using the wrong baseline of comparison for evaluating the performance of ethnofederal states, for selecting cases on the dependent variable, for ascribing to ethnofederalism what should be ascribed to other variables, and for relying on certain questionable assumptions about separatism.},

	volume = {54},
	doi = {10.1353/wp.2002.0002},
	abstract = {The granting of autonomous status to minority populations has gained support among academics and practitioners alike as a way to solve, manage, and even preempt ethnic conflict. In spite of the enthusiasm for ethnofederalism, however, the provision of autonomy to minorities may actually increase rather than decrease the likelihood of conflict. Under certain political conditions, autonomy promotes the separate identity of the minority and increases its motivation and capacity to seek separation from the central state. This article presents a rudimentary theoretical framework identifying which qualities of autonomy solutions increase the likelihood of conflict. It discusses how autonomy relates to other factors conducive to conflict by studying minorities in the South Caucasus and examines the case of Georgia. In Georgia, there were five ethnic minority populations, two of whom--the Abkhaz and the South Ossetians--enjoyed autonomous status and were the only minorities to engage in armed conflict with the Georgian government. This article shows how autonomy, by empowering ethnic elites with control of statelike institutions and by enhancing factors such as leadership, economic viability, and external support, played a crucial role in the escalation of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Conversely, the absence of autonomy mitigated separatist and secessionist sentiments among two of Georgia's other minority groups--Javakheti's Armenian and Kvemo Kartli's Azeri populations.},

	abstract = {This article presents a baseline theory of asymmetrical federalism in multinational states. Two arguments building on a game-theoretic foundation link central and regional elites’ strategic choices to questions of federal stability. The first argument concerns the creation of asymmetrical institutions. In a confrontation game between the center and national minorities credibly threatening to exit the framework, the center’s decision to grant asymmetrical autonomy ensures mutual cooperation. Yet by extending the level of autonomy for minority regions, federal asymmetry creates a third player, the nonadvantaged regions. Consequently, the second argument models asymmetrical federalism as a “nested game” where events in the ethnonational arena determine the payoffs in the federal arena. Asymmetrical federal rules turn out to be inherently unstable from a perspective that takes all actors in all arenas into account. A narrative of the development of Russian federalism exemplifies the theory.},

	abstract = {This report analyses the radicalisation and Islamisation of the Chechen separatist movement.
Three developments have contributed to this radicalisation. Firstly, the 1994–96 war in Chechnya resulted in the personal radicalisation of several Chechen warlords and politicians. These actors formed a radical opposition to the moderate regime of President Aslan Maskhadov in the interwar period and pushed for the implementation of Islamist policies in Chechnya. Secondly, international Islamists have attempted to co-opt the Chechen separatist movement. They allied themselves to the radical Chechen warlords and acquired influence through supplying money and fighting skills. Thirdly, Russia’s handling of Chechnya during the interwar period and the second war has contributed to marginalise the moderate forces in Chechnya that might have withstood the influence of the more radical warlords.
The combination of radical warlords aligned with international Islamists on the one hand, and hard Russian policies on the other, has trapped the conflict in a mode of interaction where a peaceful, negotiated solution now seems unlikely.},
