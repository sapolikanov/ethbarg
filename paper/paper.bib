	abstract = {Decades of investment decisions by central planners left communist societies with structures of production ill-prepared for competitive markets. Similar to the effects identified in the “China shock” literature, post-market-shock outcomes reflect pre-market-shock industrial geography. Tracking presidential voting in Russia at the district level in the 1990s, we document asymmetric reactions to the rapid liberalization of markets in 1992. Electoral support for the pro-market incumbent, as well as nighttime light intensity, declined more in districts whose inherited structures of production made them more vulnerable to reforms. By controlling for provincial fixed effects, we plausibly filter out the impact of post-1992 policy variation, allowing us to shed new light on an old debate about the importance of “initial conditions” to the trajectories of post-communist societies.},

The state governors are classified along a 5-item autonomy index based on events data and content analysis of their speeches, declarations, petitions, threats and actions from 1991–1995 as reported in two regional sources. Theoretical propositions derived from four schools of thought (essentialism, instrumentalism, relative deprivation and resource mobilization) are tested to discover which, if any, provide useful insights into the preferences and behavior of regional elites in Russia. In the end, a combined model that synthesizes elements of the above is shown to be most useful in explaining variation in elite positions.},

	shorttitle = {Federal Bargaining in Post-Soviet Russia},
	abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to examine the nature of federal bargaining in post-Soviet Russia by comparing Moscow̕s negotiations with Russia̕s two oil-rich republics in the Middle Volga: Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. In particular, the thesis attempts to explain how Bashkortostan was able to gain autonomy from Moscow that is very close to the level of autonomy enjoyed by Tatarstan, despite the fact that Bashkortostan is clearly in a disadvantageous position when compared to Tatarstan and the Bashkorts form only the third largest ethnic group in the Republic after the Russians and the Tatars. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that sometimes the relatively disadvantageous party in federal bargaining might be given more autonomy not because of its bargaining power, but because of the general bargaining strategy of the federal center. Therefore this thesis is an attempt to understand how Moscow, fearing that Tatarstan might emerge as the hegemonic power in the Middle Volga, sought to strengthen the position of Bashkortostan against Tatarstan, and how the success of the Bashkort political elite to manipulate the weaknesses of Moscow in the post-Soviet arena provided Bashkortostan with more or less same degree of autonomy compared to that of Tatarstan̕s.},

	abstract = {One of the most inﬂuential approaches to the management of ethno-political conﬂicts – power-sharing – assumes that politically salient ethnic groups should be included in the policy-making process through special arrangements concerning the allocation of political ofﬁces between ethnic segments. This article compares the practices of the allocation of political ofﬁces in Russian national republics and aims to examine to what extent they depend on the ethnic composition of the population. Comparative analysis demonstrates that although ethnic lines are a signiﬁcant factor in regional politics in almost all the cases, stable practices of power-sharing have emerged in approximately half of Russian national republics. Since Russian legislation does not allow ethnic parties, ethnic quotas or similar arrangements, informal power-sharing conventions are used so that speciﬁc political positions are attached to speciﬁc ethnic groups. In multisegmented republics, all signiﬁcant ethnic groups have their ‘own’ position in accordance with the share of the group in the population. In bi-segmented republics, a dominant ethnic group controls the main post of Head while a minority group is given second-order positions. At the same time, there are some cases where the allocation of positions deviates from the ethnic structure.},

The central objective in this study is to demonstrate the importance of political, economic, geographic and cultural determinants, or structural resources, in center-region relations in the Russian Federation during the 1990s. Structural resources have provided regional leaders with structural power in the federal bargaining game.

Many Russian politicians and most scholars of Russian politics view asymmetric bilateral bargaining as a dangerous institutional choice contributing to federal instability and potentially threatening the disintegration of Russia. We offer an alternative view. While the treaty-signing practices are actively maintained by Russian political elites, we argue that the genesis of asymmetric bilateral bargaining in Russia had a strong ‘path dependence’ component. In particular, it was precipitated by the developments of the last period in evolution of the Soviet federalism.},

	abstract = {The growing research on fiscal and political federalism in economics (as well as rational choice political science) basically shares two main assumptions regarding federal institutions: it takes democratic and symmetric federations as the reference point. Democracy means that the decision making is based on elections and/or referenda, which effectively constraint the actions of politicians. Symmetry means that the ”degree of devolution” for all regions is identical. In particular, if both federal and regional budgets are funded by a common split tax, the de-jure retention rate is identical for all states. It goes without saying that there is a multitude of models looking at economic asymmetry between regions: most federations include states or regions with significantly different economic potential, population and territory, obviously influencing both their comparative economic performance and their behavior in the federal bargaining. However, the economic asymmetry does not (necessarily) provide an identity mapping into the asymmetric devolution in terms of formal institutions and informal policy making (what I refer to as ”asymmetric federation” in this paper): this issue requires careful analysis.},

This paper examines statistically why some—such as Chechnya and Tatarstan—have come to epitomize demands for greater independence, while others—such as Mordovia or Chukotka—have remained largely quiescent. It finds that, while a Muslim religious tradition predisposed a region's leaders to press greater separatist demands, such primordial factors werefilteredthrough a rational calculus of the region's relative bargaining power in negotiations with the center and of the leader's own organizational interests. Contrary to some leading theories, the most developed, resource-rich, and high-income groups and regions were more separatist than more economically backward ones.},
