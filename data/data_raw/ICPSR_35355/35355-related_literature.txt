The debate on Russia’s innovation performance has paid little attention to
the role of geography. This paper addresses this gap by applying an
‘augmented’ regional knowledge function approach to examine the territorial
dynamics of innovation in Russia. The empirical results suggest that
regional R&D investments are strong predictors of local innovative
performance. However, R&D activities are inadequately connected to regional
human capital resources. The activities of foreign firms play a fundamental
role as ‘global knowledge pipelines’. Different territorial dynamics of
innovation are observed in the European and the Asian part of Russia, with
regions to the East of the Urals less likely to benefit from interregional
knowledge spillovers. The historical legacy from the Soviet era still
emerges as a strong predictor of current innovative performance, shedding
light on the importance of long-term path dependency in the Russian
geography of innovation.
